# gamepadviewer-css-xboxmini
gamepadviewer.com custom css for a small xbox 360 view 

Other people had this but they were referencing a bunch of external sources that may go away some day so I made one using only local assets and then turn it into a github page.

## Usage

- regular minimal css (I turn off the curving of stick as well): https://gamepadviewer.com/?p=1&nocurve=1&css=https://vrillusions.github.io/gamepadviewer-css-xboxmini/minimal.css
